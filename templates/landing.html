        <h2>Welcome to URLScout</h2>
        <p><strong>Your Guardian Against Phishing Threats</strong></p>

        <p>In the digital age, online security is more important than ever. Every day, millions of people around the world fall victim to phishing attacks — cybercrimes where malicious websites trick users into sharing sensitive personal information. At <strong>URLScout</strong>, we’re here to help you stay safe.</p>

        <h3>What is URLScout?</h3>
        <p><strong>URLScout</strong> is an intelligent <em>Phishing Detection System</em> designed to identify and flag potentially malicious websites. With our cutting-edge machine learning models, we analyze the URLs you visit and predict the likelihood of them being malicious. If a URL has a high probability of being harmful, you’ll be alerted, giving you the tools to make informed decisions about your online safety.</p>

        <h3>How It Works:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Submit a URL</strong>: Simply paste any URL into our system.</li>
            <li><strong>Instant Prediction</strong>: Our system analyzes the URL using advanced algorithms and machine learning models.</li>
            <li><strong>Get Results</strong>: Receive a prediction on whether the URL is safe or potentially harmful, based on a risk probability score.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Why URLScout?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Protection:</strong> Get instant results to avoid phishing sites before they can harm you.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Machine Learning:</strong> We use sophisticated algorithms, including a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), to ensure the most accurate predictions.</li>
            <li><strong>Easy-to-Use:</strong> Simple interface, quick results — no technical expertise required!</li>
            <li><strong>Free and Accessible:</strong> URLScout is available for everyone, anytime, anywhere.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How the Model Works</h3>
        <p>The system uses a <strong>Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)</strong> model, a type of artificial neural network, to classify URLs as legitimate or malicious. The model has been trained on a large dataset containing 450,000 URL samples. The training process involved extracting various features such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>URL Length:</strong> The total length of the URL.</li>
            <li><strong>Hostname Length:</strong> Length of the domain name.</li>
            <li><strong>Path Length:</strong> Length of the path after the domain name.</li>
            <li><strong>Entropy:</strong> Measures the randomness of the URL, indicating its complexity.</li>
            <li><strong>Suspicious Keywords:</strong> Detection of any harmful or misleading keywords in the URL.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These features are then processed through the MLP model, which evaluates the patterns and relationships in the data to predict the likelihood of a phishing attempt. The prediction is displayed as a risk probability, helping users identify potentially harmful websites before they click.</p>
